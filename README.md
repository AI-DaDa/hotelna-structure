# Hotelna

**Hotelna** is a revolutionary hotel booking platform that provides transparent, professional reviews of hospitality properties. Our mission is to bridge the gap between traveler expectations and reality by offering honest, verified assessments from hospitality professionals.

## 🏨 About Hotelna

Hotelna was born from a real travel experience where a family vacation was nearly ruined by misleading hotel listings. We believe that travelers deserve authentic, trustworthy information before making booking decisions.
